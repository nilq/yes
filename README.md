# yes
A programming language based on ~~functions~~ something and objects.

Made for educational purposes, please use this for something big and do consider noticing me if you use this to take over the world etc. etc..

Usage stuff
---

in `src/` ...

run a simple REPL:

`./yes`

run a file:

`./yes path/to/file.yes`

This - though - might throw errors at you, in this case, just replace `./` with `ruby `.

``


Example
---

This should work, will test later ... :

```
something Hello:
  func fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
      0
    n + fib(n - 1)

  func dont_call_this(not_sure):
    while yes:
      nothing
```
